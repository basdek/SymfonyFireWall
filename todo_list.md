# todo list 
## Quant Utilities MongoRouterBundle

- Fix that a route that you add via the new route menu with a checked active box actually becomes active  

- Think of a comments/notes thing per route?

	 **!** Don't select that while iterating over the routes to find a match

- Write the caching feauture

### To overthink:

1. A undo button would be awesome 
2. Also multi select and a 'with select dropdown'

## General firewall todo's and ideas

- Write something to add a second database (*mySQL*) and entity manager on the fly in Symfony

*Probably searchable with something like 'dynamic added databases in Symfony'*

### Excelent ideas on how to build some of the required components

- Communication with the second $em to the WP_db 
- Using cUrl to get the pages?
- Using Ajax to preload the pages before recaching them -> live preview
